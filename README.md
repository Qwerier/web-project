# Bibliophile
Bibliophile is an online shopping platform created with PHP, JavaScript, SQL and run in localhost from XAMPP.

# Setup
Before deployment, one should download the ```database.sql``` file as it contains the database schema models. To run the app, one needs to start the Apache and MySQL servers from XAMPP control panel. Then writing on the browser ``` localhost\index.php``` redirects the user to the main application page. 

# About the project
Bibliophile is a demo web-app that allows the users to browse, search and buy books made available to them by the bookshop. First they are redirected to the main page featuring a choice of random books and the options to log into the account.
